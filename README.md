# Projects-and-Exercises-Completed-in-Deep-Learning-Class
Project and Exercises completed in Deep Learning Class at the University of the Philippines Diliman, Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute

Notebooks Included 
* **EE 298 Project 1: Kinship Detection using: 1. Basic BCNN and 2. OpenFace_and_BCNN** \
  This Jupyter Notebook is used to predict if two people share a kinship relationship or not based on their facial images. \
  The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/recognizing-faces-in-the-wild and consist of the following: \

* **EE 298 Project 2: Shoe Collab GAN (Generative adversarial network)** \
    Automatically generate Shoe Collaboration Designs for Super Mario and Nike
    
* **EE 298 HW: Application of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) on CIFAR10 dataset ** \

* **EE 298 HW: Application of Convolutional neural network (CNN) on CIFAR10 dataset ** \

* **EE 298 HW: Denoising Auto Encoder for Corrupted MNIST Data ** \
